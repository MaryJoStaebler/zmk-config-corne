# Corne Keyboard Layout

## Key map

The key map is subject to change as I discover my needs but I will try to keep 
this updated. 

### BASE

[NAV](#nav) is a cursor navigation and media control layer  
[NUM](#num) is a number and function key layer  
[SYM](#sym) is a symbol layer accessed by holding both `NAV` and `NUM`. It also 
has a toggle to go to [BLT](#blt) my Bluetooth control layer.
